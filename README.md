**How to Run the Demo
Using Vite (recommended for React):
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Component-Library-SDK.git
cd ticket-profile-ui
Install dependencies:
npm install
Run the development server:
npm run dev

**How to Use the Components
All components are written using custom HTML/CSS (or React if you're using JSX).
You can copy the structure from each component file (e.g., Ticket.jsx, ProfileCard.jsx) and reuse them in your project.
The styling is scoped via class names and the shared styles.css.

Example (HTML/JSX):

<div class="ticket">
  <h2 class="ticket-title">Coding Conf 2025</h2>
</div>

Make sure to include styles.css in your HTML or React entry point.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
